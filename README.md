# Students Performance Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of student performance data, focusing on identifying factors that influence exam scores. The dataset used for this analysis can be found here: [Kaggle - Students Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors).

## Key aspects of this project include:

* Exploring associations between student performance and various factors such as parental involvement, peer influence, and teacher quality.
* Investigating the impact of resources, including family income, access to educational resources, and internet access on exam scores.
* Visualizing trends in academic activities such as attendance and study habits, and how they contribute to exam results.
* Applying statistical methods, including Chi-Square tests, ANOVA, and correlation analysis, to uncover relationships and key insights from the data.

The analysis is available on Kaggle: [Students Performance Analysis Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/andriipysarevskyi/students-performance-analysis).
